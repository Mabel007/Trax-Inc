# Trax-Inc

## In this repository, I will be practicing both front and backend.

### The languages I'm going to use are HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL.

#### I want to build this system with no frameworks or libraries, to see how conversant I am with vanilla codes.

#### I am going to create a full system which will include a registration, login,home, contact, about, and services page.

#### There will be server-side validation which will be done with PHP and MySQL and client-side validation which will be done with Javascript... But maybe as I proceed I will include jQuery.

#### I am starting with the registration page, create the html skeleton and style with css.
